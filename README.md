# pandas_workshop
Built-in data structures in Python are insufficient for data analysis. This workshop introduces Pandas, a Python library that facilitates efficient and simple data analysis with easy-to-use data structures. I will assume you're at least at a beginner level in Python. Please come with Anaconda for Python 3.6 installed (https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
